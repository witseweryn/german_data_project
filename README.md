# german_data_project
This project presents a data analysis and machine learning approach to the Statlog (German Credit Data) dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information on 1,000 loan applicants, each described by 20 attributes, and labeled as either a "good" or "bad" credit risk.
